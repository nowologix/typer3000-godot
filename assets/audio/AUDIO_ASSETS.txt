IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
============================================

SoundManager handles graceful fallback when audio files are missing.
The game will run silently for missing sounds without crashing.

All audio plays through AudioStreamPlayer nodes with:
- 8 pooled SFX players for simultaneous sounds
- 1 dedicated music player with volume control
- Master/SFX/Music volume sliders (0.0 to 1.0)

Audio buses can be configured in Godot's Audio tab for:
- Master bus
- SFX bus (for sound effects)
- Music bus (for background music)
